Fedora live respins autotorrent
--------------------------------

A script that checks for new re-spins that the Fedora community puts up, and
automatically downloads the torrent files to help seed them.

It should be run as a cronjob, and should be modified to fit the torrent client
and so on that each user uses.

The `Fedora community <https://getfedora.org>`__ regularly produces live
respins to save users extra bandwidth on updates. They can be found here:
